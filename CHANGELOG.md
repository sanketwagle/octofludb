v1.0.4 [2026-05-11]
===================

 * Fix `prep table --segment-key`
 * Update subtype and constellation make/write functions to use strain ID to construct
   corresponding turtle file. Previously, strain name was used to derive strain ID, which
   fails when the original strain name is altered.

v1.0.3 [2026-05-07]
===================

 * Update host parsing to account for variety of hosts for H5N1
 * Make table parsing preferentially select headings matching a classifier typename
 * Fix overly robust parsers that were causing excessively high goodness scores

v1.0.2 [2023-11-03]
===================

 * Make constellation determination more robust with partial, case-insensitive matching
 * Correct H3 motif by adding missing site (159)
 * Fix fetch-unclassified-swine.rq to include GISAID strains

v1.0.1 [2022-02-16]
===================

 * Fix dependency handling

v1.0.0 [2022-02-11]
===================

 My final release

v0.13.1 [2021-12-22]
====================

 * Fix bug in `prep unpublished`

v0.13.0 [2021-12-17]

====================

 * Bug fixes

v0.12.0 [2021-12-15]

   `octofludb pull` with `--include-gisaid`)
 * Fix read error in `octofludb prep fasta`
 * Remove the `octofludb make` subcommand
   - moved `octofludb make masterlist` to `octofludb report masterlist` 
   - removed `const` and `subtypes`, just run SPARQL queries instead

v0.11.0 [2021-11-08]
====================

 * Add motif generation to `pull`
 * Add options to limit what data is updated with `pull`
 * Add deletion commands

v0.10.1 [2021-10-19]
====================

 * Bug fixes in octoFLU wrapper

v0.10.0 [2021-10-06]
====================
 
 * Move imports to location of use (speeds usage mesages)
 * Remove unused `clean` command
 * Bug fixes

v0.9.0 [2021-09-24]
===================

 * Remove `script` folder and all bash scripting
 * Add `pull` subcommand for updating the database
 * Add `classify` subcommand as a wrapper around octoFLU
 * Add a config file that contains links to all data and the octoFLU reference

v0.8.0 [2021-08-12]
===================

 * Fix subtype generation
 * Fix bugs in init
 * Add `report monthly --context` to pull sequences for comparisons
 * Add support for the the SPARQL CONSTRUCT command
 * Do not generate "unknown" triples

v0.7.0 [2021-04-12]
===================

 * Add monthly report generator (used for WGS selections)
 * Standardize subtype handling (see runtest `get_subtypes` tests)
 * Replace "VTX98" with "LAIV" in internal gene parser
 * Add header to `octofludb make const` output
 * Add handlers for working with unpublished data
 * Convert internal gene clades to uppercase

v0.6.0
======

 * Add options for updating a certain number of months to `update_gb`
 * Add maxyear option to `update_gb`
 * Fix bug in `update_gb` that prevented updating of pre-2000 data
 * Fix handling of segment subtypes
 * Determine strain subtype using octoFLU info

v0.5.1
======

 * in `update_gb` - work backwards through months, not just years

v0.5.0
======

 * new subcommands:
   * `update_gb`: add missing genbank entries
   * `const`: generate constellations for all swine strains
   * `masterlist`: generate the A0 masterlist used in NADC quarterly/annual
     reports and octoflushow

 * cleaner strain name parsing:
   * require two forward slashes
   * remove parenthesis/bracket terms, for example:
        "A/wherever/2020 (H1N1)" --> "A/whereever/2020"
   * replace space with underscores, for example:
        "A/South Dakota/2020" --> ""A/South_Dakota/2020""

 * improved data extraction from genbank records 
   * link parental strains to genbank segment records
   * link strain info to the parental strain, including: 
     * host - with new cleaning
     * country - with new cleaning
     * A0 numbers - for USA strains
     * states - for USA strains
     * collection date - as string literal
   * fix incorrect (s, length, locus) link
   * convert `create_date` from string literal to date
   * convert `update_date` from string literal to date
   * convert `length` from string literal to integer

v0.4.0
======

 * Update patterns for global clades
   * allow "Other-Equine" and such
   * allow lowercase letters after "3.XXXX."

v0.3.0
======

 * Add first recipe - a subcommand for getting all constellations
 * Allow the constellation MIXED and allow X for unknown clades

v0.2.0
======

 * Change default repo name to "octofludb"
 * Replace docopt with argparse
 * Renamed all `load_*` commands to `mk_*`. The commands are not "loading" data
   into the database but only creating turtle files
 * Change name to octofludb
 * Add query and upload subcommands
 * Remove `sameAs` relationship between `Strain` tokens. This relationship was
   equating strain names (e.g. `A/Michigan/288/2019`) with epiflu isolate ids
   (e.g., `EPI_ISL_381463`). However, one strain name may be shared by multiple
   epiflu isloate ids, so the sameAs relationship is incorrect. 

v0.1.0
======

Everything up to the point where the name changed from d79 to octofludb
